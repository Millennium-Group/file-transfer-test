# file-transfer-test
This is pull request from Long Su(https://www.guru.com/freelancers/long-su) in Guru and I will add some module codes and my dev plan for this remote software project.
I will use with Rust dev config for this project.
1. Networking
connection.rs/service.rs file for the features.
2. Security:
Sha256 algorithum will use for the security.
3. Memory/File Management:
bytes_codec.rs and compress.rs/tcp,udp,socket_client,fs.rs files
4.Code Organization:
I will do when real start the projects.
5.Error Handling:
Sure, all errors/security problems will process myself.
