# Secure File Transfer Module

This Python module facilitates secure file transfer between a client and a server over a network. The module focuses on memory management, networking, and security aspects to ensure a robust and secure file transfer process.

## Features

- **Networking:**
  - Implements a client and server using Python sockets.
  - Allows the client to upload a file to the server securely.

- **Security:**
  - Encrypts the file during transmission using AES encryption.
  - Implements proper memory management to handle sensitive data securely.
  - Ensures secure encryption and decryption processes without exposing sensitive information in memory.

- **Memory Management:**
  - Implements secure memory allocation and deallocation practices.
  - Avoids storing sensitive information in plain text in memory for extended periods.

- **File Handling:**
  - Efficiently handles both small and large files.
  - Implements mechanisms to resume interrupted file transfers.

- **Code Organization:**
  - Follows PEP 8 style guidelines for code organization and naming conventions.
  - Includes comments explaining each function's purpose and significant code sections.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Implements robust error handling for potential networking issues, file-related problems, and security concerns.
  - Uses exceptions appropriately to handle errors and edge cases.

## Challenges Faced

- **Key Length Mismatch:** One challenge faced was ensuring that the ciphertext length matched the key size during encryption and decryption. This required careful consideration of padding schemes and key generation.

- **Network Communication:** Ensuring seamless communication between the client and server, handling timeouts, and addressing potential network issues posed challenges during development.

## Potential Areas for Improvement

- **Logging:** Introduce a comprehensive logging mechanism to capture detailed information about the execution, errors, and key events.

- **Testing:** Enhance the testing suite to cover various scenarios, including edge cases and performance testing for large files.

- **User Interface:** Develop a simple user interface for better interaction, feedback, and visualization of the file transfer process.

- **Security Auditing:** Conduct thorough security audits and consider third-party security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

- **Optimizations:** Explore opportunities for performance optimizations, such as implementing a more efficient file encryption algorithm or utilizing multithreading for improved parallelism.

## Usage

### Server

1. Run the server script:

    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

2. The server will listen for incoming connections.

### Client

1. Run the client script, providing the path to the file you want to transfer:

    ```bash
    python client.py
    ```

2. The client will connect to the server, exchange keys, encrypt the file, and send it securely.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- cryptography library (`pip install cryptography`)
